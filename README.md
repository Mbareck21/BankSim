# BankSim


BankSim is a web application that simulates a simple banking system. I created this project as a way to practice my web development skills and learn how to use Tailwind, a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of customizable classes for styling HTML elements. The web application allows users to create an account, deposit and withdraw money, and view their transaction history.


# Features

 > Users can sign up with their email and password, and log in to access their account. The user data is stored in the browserâ€™s sessionStorage only, so it will be cleared when the browser is closed or refreshed.
* **Account management**:
  > Users can view, add an initial balance.
* **Transaction operations**:
  > Users can deposit and withdraw money from their account, and transfer funds to other accounts.
* **Transaction history**:
  > Users can view their past transactions, filter them by date and type, and download them as a CSV file.
